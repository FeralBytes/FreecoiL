# EASY: PreCompiled Binaries
The precompiled binaries make it easy to start contributing. Just download the "Godot Editor Binary for Linux Compiled for FreecoiL" and the "Godot FreecoiL Android Template Debug" files from [this download page](https://gitlab.com/FeralBytes/FreecoiL/snippets/1781429). The Godot Editor Binary is the editor with FreecoiL built into it. The other file is to be saved in a known location. The in the editor under tools -> export -> under the "Android" preset you can set the debug templates to the Godot FreecoiL Android Template Debug which is a ".apk" file that has the FreecoiL module built into it.
