# Contributing to FreeCoiL
First, thanks for taking the time to contribute to make this game even better!
Everything referred to hereafter as an "issue" also applies to feature requests.
The golden rule is to always open one issue for one bug. If you notice several bugs 
and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
## Contributing with a Merge or Pull Request
Please make all MR's or PR's against the "develop" branch, unless directed to do 
otherwise. Also make sure you update the CHANGELOG.md with an appropriate comment.
Make sure that your PR leaves the game in a stable state before requesting that it 
is merged into develop. Otherwise use the WIP tag to identify that the PR is not 
ready to merge yet.
This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make 
it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts 
when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
## The More Features the Better
Most features will be accepted, becasue that is the point of this game. But you 
must make sure that by adding your feature it does not break previous features
and it should be able to be turned on or off. When I say most features will be
accepted I am saying if the code to implement the feature is completed by 
someone else. I currently have my own agenda for what features need to be 
added next to the game.
## Professionalism
Please be respectful of others and mind your language, this is a public forum. 
Disagreements happen but can be settled if both parties are open minded.
