# Contributing to LazerCoiL
Everything referred to hereafter as an "issue" also applies to feature requests.
The golden rule is to always open one issue for one bug. If you notice several bugs 
and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
## Contributing with a Pull Request
Please make all PR's against the "develop" branch, unless directed to do otherwise. 
Also make sure you update the CHANGELOG.md with an appropriate comment.
Make sure that you PR leaves the game in a stable state before requesting that it 
is merged into develop. Otherwise use the WIP tag to identify that the PR is not 
ready to merge yet.
## The More Features the Better
Most features will be accepted, becasue that is the point of this game. But you 
must make sure that by adding your feature it does not break previous features
and it should be able to be turned on or off.
## Professionalism
Please be respectful of others and mind your language, this is a public forum. 
Disagreements happen but can be settled if both parties are open minded.
## Contacting The Maintainer
The best way is currently via gitlab issues. If nesseccary We will add a discord
channel in the future.
