## What is LazerCoiL?
LazerCoil is a laser tag application for the RECOIL[2] system for Android[6]. The focus is to add more features to the game environment, offer more flexibility and customization to players, and increase replayability. 

### Features like:

* Partial Networking: Ability for players to drop out of the network but still play, then receive updates when back in range. 
  * Play does not stop just because you left the Wi-Fi coverage area. [5]
* Network Enabled: Support of Scoreboard and Achievements.
  * Support for development of enhanced game modes.
* Dedicated Host Flexibility: Server OS options: Android, Linux, & Windows.[7]
  * Host pushes settings to other players, but can enable some settings to be set by the players.
* Multiple Game Modes
  * Free For All: supporting up to 62 Players. [4]
  * Team Modes: supporting 2-31 teams up to 62 players. [4]
  * Weapon Profiles: for handgun, shotgun, rifle, and machine gun. [8]

## Why LazerCoiL?
LazerCoil was created because we wanted more features and flexibility than what was offered by the RECOIL[2] app. When we found SIMPLECOIL[3], it inspired us to begin coding our desired features. We wanted more than those offered by either RECOIL[2] or SIMPLECOIL[3].

## Frequently Asked Questions:
* Does this really work or are you creating a hoax? 
* * Actually our app already works, it has worked for months now, but we are improving and adding features. It communicates with the guns and already supports team and individual play.

## Note To SkyRocket LLC

## Notes:
1. GOOGLE PLAY and the Google Play logo are trademarks of Google LLC.

3. SIMPLECOIL is copyright of Dees-Troy.
4. This feature has not been tested completely, but the software and hardware can, in theory and as programmed, support the capability. If you test this feature to its maximum extent, please let us know if it worked as promised. If it did not, please inform us of limitations or bugs encountered.
5. Some game modes may require all players to stay on the network at all times. But it is our goal to not have this be the case. Currently, all of our game modes support network drop-out with little affect to game play. However, it is important to realize that, due to the way the guns work, if a player is killed outside the network, determining who killed him will not be updated until the killed player returns to the network.
6. Our work is portable to iOS / iPhone, but at this time we have not begun development for iOS. The GUI is already compatable with iOS though. The backend needs to be written in swift.
7. OSX will likely be supported but has not been tested. The GUI is technically comptabale with OSX already.
8. Weapon Profiles do not affect range, only the way in which the weapon fires and reloads. There may be a few ways to figure out range, but no time has been dedicated to this yet.
9. Dees-Troy's research was critical to enabling us to make our application.
